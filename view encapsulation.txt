        ShadowDom

            uses the browser's native shadow DOM implementation to attach a shadow
            DOM to the component's host element, and then puts the component view
            inside that shadow DOM. The components styles are included within the
            shadow DOM

        Native

            uses a now deprecated version of the browser's native shadow DOM
            implementation

        Emulated (default)

            emulates the behavior of shadow DOM by preprocessing and renaming the
            CSS code to effectively scope the CSS to the component's view 

        None

            does no view encapsulation. Angular adds the CSS to the global styles.
            The scoping rules, isolations, and protections don't apply

    change detection

        as the application logic updates component data, values that are bound to
        DOM properties that view can change. The change detector is responsible for
        updating the view to reflect the current data model. Similarly, the user
        can interact with the UI, causing event that change the state of the data
        model. These events can trigger change detection.

        runs after every DOM event

        change-detection strategy

            CheckAlways

                the change detector goes through the view hierarchy on each VM turn
                to check every data-bound property in the template.

                phases

                    frist

                        compares the current state of the dependent data with the
                        prevoius one, and collects changes

                    second

                        updates the page DOM to reflect any new data values

            CheckOnce

                runs only when explicitly invoked, or when it is triggered by an
                Input reference change or event handler

        pipes

            pure

                pipes are defined as pure so that Angular executes the pipe only
                when it detects a pure change to the input value. A pure change is 
                either change to primitive input value, or changed object referance

            impure

                Angular executes an ipure pipe every time it detect a change with
                every keystroke or mouse movement
